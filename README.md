This program simulates a homing missile with lateral thrusters as the control mechanism. It is an accurate approximation of a 2 meter long missile on Earth with rudimentary air drag physics.

The missile can be controlled with the up, left, and right arrow keys. The up arrow controls the main thruster and the left and right arrows control the lateral thrusters.
